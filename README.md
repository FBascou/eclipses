LUNAR ECLIPSE DETAILS

+ GREATEST ECLIPSE: the instant when the distance between the axis of Earth's umbral shadow and the center of the Moon's disk reaches a minimum.

+ SAROS: the periodicity and recurrence of eclipses is governed by the Saros cycle, a period of approximately 6,585.3 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours). It was known to the Chaldeans as a period when lunar eclipses seem to repeat themselves, but the cycle is applicable to solar eclipses as well.
  + For more info: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros.html

+ UMBRAL MAGNITUDE: the fraction of the Moon's diameter obscured by Earth's umbral shadow at the instant of greatest eclipse. For total eclipses, the umbral magnitude is always greater than or equal to 1. For partial eclipses, the umbral magnitude is always greater than 0 and less than 1. For penumbral eclipses, the umbral magnitude is always negative (i.e., less than 0).

+ ECLIPSE DURATION: is the duration of the partial phase of a partial eclipse. For total eclipses two values are given: 
  + The first value is the period between the beginning and end of the partial phases
  + The second value is the duration of the total phase

+ GEOGRAPHIC REGION OF ECLIPSE VISIBILITY: the portion of Earth's surface where some portion of the eclipse can be seen. 
  + Geographic abbreviations: n = north, s = south, e = east, w = west, c = central

SOLAR ECLIPSE DETAILS

+ GREATEST ECLIPSE: the instant when the distance between the Moon's shadow axis and Earth's center reaches a minimum.

+ SAROS: the periodicity and recurrence of eclipses is governed by the Saros cycle, a period of approximately 6,585.3 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours). It was known to the Chaldeans as a period when lunar eclipses seem to repeat themselves, but the cycle is applicable to solar eclipses as well.

+ HYBRID ECLIPSES: also known as annular/total eclipses. Such an eclipse is both total and annular along different sections of its umbral path.

+ ECLIPSE MAGNITUDE: the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon. For annular eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is always less than 1. For total eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is always greater than or equal to 1. For both annular and total eclipses, the value listed is actually the ratio of diameters between the Moon and the Sun.

+ ECLIPSE DURATION: is the duration of a total or annular eclipse at Greatest Eclipse. Greatest Eclipse is the instant when the axis of the Moon's shadow passes closest to Earth's center.

+ GEOGRAPHIC REGION OF ECLIPSE VISIBILITY: the portion of Earth's surface where a partial eclipse can be seen. 
  + Geographic abbreviations (used above): n = north, s = south, e = east, w = west, c = central
